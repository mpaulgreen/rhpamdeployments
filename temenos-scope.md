Architecture Design Phase
    Phase 2 : Architecture design
        Red Hat conducts design workshops to adopt the Customer requirements defines the design as per the Red Hat reference architecture and maps the requirements to an overall architecture and design. The OpenShift infrastructure would provide the foundation for all upcoming application.  

Conducting design sessions to plan Prod  Non-Prod , DR and UAT Installations, which may include the following topics: 
●	Platform management roles and responsibilities
●	Capacity planning
●	Network zoning
●	Storage architecture
●	Number of clusters and usage and criteria for each
●	Platform deployment
●	Project onboarding
●	CI/CD planning


Out Of Scope
The Deliverables are strictly limited to those set in scope above, and shall not include any further tasks, deliverables or other features, including without limitation, the items described below. Without limiting the foregoing, Client acknowledges and agrees that the following are not within the scope of this engagement:
●	 Defining automated processes for creating additional OpenShift clusters.
●	Implementing and supporting design of complex network topologies (e.g. network availability zones inside the OpenShift cluster and/or clusters that span multiple data centers/cloud instances, or integration with third-party SDN solutions)
●	Red Hat Consulting typically works with OpenShift deployment pipelines implemented through Jenkins and GitLab or GitHub. Other technologies may require custom scoping for subsequent phases/engagements as determined through the Container Platform Discovery Session.
●	Validating applications in OpenShift or changing applications as necessary to allow them to function properly inside Red Hat certified Docker containers. If application code or platform configuration requires significant changes to function inside OpenShift Container Platform, we assume CUSTOMER developers and/or system administrators will be available to assist in debugging and applying fixes.
●	Full Installation, configuration, and integration of CloudForms is not included in this scope but will be covered in subsequent phases/engagements
●	Application containerization and CI/CD pipeline not in scope but Red Hat will support in design workshops to shows Customer team on the process needed
●	Application migration
●	Dashboard creation
●	Customer specific security testing
●	Charge back of projects
●	Deployment to Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure
